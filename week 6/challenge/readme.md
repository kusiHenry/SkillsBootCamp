# Python README File Generator

## Challenge

Having a quality `README.md` file for your GitHub repositories is always a good idea. It sets you apart as a developer and helps potential employers understand your projects better. In this challenge, you'll put into practice everything you've learned this week to create something reusable across all your projects.

Your challenge is to build a Python script that prompts the user for details about their GitHub project using `PyInquirer`. The questions should include:

- Project Title
- Description
- Installation Instructions
- Usage Information
- License (choose from a dropdown list)
- Author Name
- Contact Information

The application will then generate a `README.md` file using GitHub-flavored markdown.

You should use classes and modules to organize your code. A `requirements.txt` file and a virtual environment should be used, and instructions for setting up the project must be included.

Since this project can't be deployed via GitHub Pages, submit a short video demonstrating the application in action, along with a link to the GitHub repository.

## Key Learnings

- Python scripting and project structure
- Creating and using classes
- Markdown syntax for GitHub
- Working with `PyInquirer`
- Managing Python dependencies with `requirements.txt`
- Creating reusable development tools

## User Story

As a developer,
I want to automatically generate a professional README file for my GitHub projects,
So that I can save time and ensure my repositories are well-documented.
