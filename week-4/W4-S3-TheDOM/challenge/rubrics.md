# Grading Rubric: The Interactive TODO List

---

### **Technical Functionality – 35%**

Evaluates the core functionality and adherence to project requirements:

- Users can **add new tasks** via an input and button.
- Tasks are **dynamically rendered** to the DOM upon addition.
- Tasks are **validated** (non-empty, and ideally unique) before being added.
- Users can **delete tasks**, and the DOM updates accordingly.
- (Bonus) Users can **edit tasks**, update the content, and save changes dynamically.

---

### **JavaScript & DOM Manipulation – 25%**

Assesses JavaScript skills and DOM handling:

- Proper use of **event listeners** for user interactions (e.g., button clicks, Enter key).
- Effective use of **JavaScript arrays or data structures** to manage tasks.
- DOM updates are correctly synchronized with the task array (add/delete/edit).
- Clean, modular JavaScript code with meaningful variable/function names.

---

### **Input Validation & Error Handling – 10%**

Measures how well the application handles user input:

- Prevents adding **empty or invalid tasks**.
- Provides clear **user feedback** for invalid inputs (e.g., warning messages).
- Optional: Prevents **duplicate entries** or provides visual cues when a task already exists.

---

### **Bonus Feature Implementation – 10%**

Rewards the optional editing feature:

- Edit buttons are available next to each task.
- Clicking edit allows task modification and saving.
- DOM updates and task array updates are in sync.
- UI/UX around editing is intuitive and clean.

---

### **Code Quality & Structure – 10%**

Examines maintainability and cleanliness of code:

- Uses **semantic HTML** and follows best practices.
- JavaScript code is **organized**, uses functions, and avoids repetition.
- File structure is logical (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
- Comments and indentation improve readability.

---

### **Deployment – 5%**

Verifies project visibility and working deployment:

- Project is successfully deployed via **GitHub Pages**.
- Live link is provided and functional.
- All features (add/delete/edit) work as expected on the deployed site.

---

### **Repository Quality – 5%**

Checks Git and documentation hygiene:

- Clear repository name and description.
- Descriptive `README.md` with challenge details and deployment link.
